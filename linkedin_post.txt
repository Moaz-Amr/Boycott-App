🚀 **Excited to Share My Latest Project: Boycott Checker!** 🚀

I am thrilled to introduce my new Tkinter application, **Boycott Checker**, designed to help users easily determine if a brand is part of a boycott. 

### Key Features:
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter, the application provides an intuitive interface for seamless interaction.
- **Brand Checking**: Users can enter a brand name and quickly find out if it is part of the boycott list.
- **Dynamic Background**: The app includes a feature to toggle between different themes for a personalized experience.

### How It Works:
1. Enter the brand name in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button to see if the brand is part of the boycott.
3. The result will be displayed instantly!

### Installation:
Clone the repository, install any required dependencies, and run `project.py` to start the application.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvements! Let's work together to make a positive impact! 🌍
